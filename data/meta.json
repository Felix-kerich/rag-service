To follow up and enhance more technically about the local methods, \ntechniques, learning & experiences with current cli matic requirement & technical needs are \nour major responsibility. Good Agricultural practic es, traditional knowledge, skill & \nexperience as well as research output techniques wi ll be very helpful for successful \nAgriculture work. Successful Agriculture works refe rs to increment in the production of \ncereals, vegetables & cash crops as well as their m arketing for raising the income. \nManagement of the problems which arises during the farming like; disease pest occurrence, \nsoil, Agro-materials also falls under the successiv e Agriculture work.  \nRegarding to the emerging context for commercializa tion, raising income and upliftment on \nlivelihood of farmers by technical enhancement in s imple way, we feel very happy by the \npreparation of this manual with very useful technic al knowledge. This manual which is \nprepared under the JICA project on Rehabilitation &  Recovery from Nepal Earthquake \n(RRNE) not only useful for rural Farmers, but also very useful for every technician related to \nAgriculture offices for the training material. It h as been hoped that this manual, especially \naddressing the maize production techniques will sup port for the increment of the productivity, \nimproving in quality maize production.  \nJICA/RRNE & Good Neighbors Nepal has helped much mo re for the preparation, correction, \nedition, all other related works & funding. I am al so glad to assisting the preparation of this \nmanual directly & indirectly by all persons, DADO t echnicians & technicians of Agriculture \nservice center. I am hoping for this type of manual  publication support by all readers & JICA \nNepal in near future containing other precise & imp ortant training contents & materials.  \n \nMarch, 2016        \n……………………… \nHikmat Kumar Shrestha \nSenior Agriculture Development Officer \n  \n\n  \n Government of Nepal \nMinistry of Agriculture Development \nRegional Agriculture Directorate, central developme nt Region \nDISTRICT AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT OFIICE \nGorkha \nAcknowledgement \nAmong various organizations working in Gorkha, situ ating on the central part of Agricultural \ncountry Nepal, by the support of the JICA project o n Rehabilitation & Recovery from Nepal \nEarthquake with Good Neighbors Nepal as its impleme ntation partner, this manual is very \nmuch helpful for the substantial and commercial far mers, agriculture related technicians, as it \nhas been prepared including all technical parts, an d it is seemed to be supported for the \npoverty alleviation, food security, and increasing farmers income by the increment of \nagricultural production and productivity.  \nReceiving as a reference to the available theoretic al and practical educational materials \nincluded in this Maize Farming Techniques Manual; a nd as it has covered all technical \naspects like identification of maize variety, land preparation, maize sowing, fertilizer \nmanagement, importance of different fertilizers, pr eparation of compost, seed germination \ntesting method, irrigation, weeding and weed contro l method, identification and management \nof pest and disease in maize, crop harvesting metho d, storage method, IPM method, \npreparation of organic pesticide etc., it is believ ed to be useful to especially farmers, \nrespective technicians as well as to other readers.   \n       Finally, I would like very much thanks to st aff of the JICA Project Team & Good \nneighbors Nepal for their hard work on preparation of this manual.  \n \n……………………… \nYam Kumar Shrestha \nSenior Agriculture Development Officer  \nDistrict Agriculture Development Office, Gorkha \n \n\n  \n Table of Contents \nPART I: CHARACTERISTICS OF MAIZE FARMING .......... ............................................... 1  \n1.

The average height of stalk is \n210-220 cm and can be harvested in \n110 days of sowing. Rampur \nCompost is mostly cultivated in mid-\nhills, inner-Terai and Terai areas. \nThe color of its kernel is orange-\nyellow, and it is resistant to downy \nmildew. The husk of this corn \nvariety covers till tip of the cob and \nremains safe from water; hence, this variety of fli nt corn has less problem downy mildew. \nRampur Composite gives good yields in the Terai, in ner- Terai, Mid-hills and High hills as \nwell. Therefore, District Agriculture development o ffice (DADO) suggests the cultivation of \nRampur Composite variety in the mid-hill areas.

A fter that, the germination test of the \nseed should be done. \n• To identify the  germination capacity of seeds,  th e following ways can be followed: \n\u0002 Keep sand/ soil in a flexible container or carton b ox, and remove stones from \nsand/ soil. \n\u0002 Take 200 seeds randomly from the seed bag. \n\u0002 Sow the 100 seed in one cartoon box making 10 rows with 10 seeds in each row, \nand repeat the same process for another 100 seeds i n other carton box, for \nsimultaneously getting more exact germination rate.  During sowing, seed to seed \ndistance should be 2.5 cm. to 3 cm and the depth sh ould be double of the seed size, \nand should provide daily irrigation.  \n\u0002 Count seedlings up to 7 days to know the vigor of s eed.  \n\u0002 If germination rate of seed was found more than 85% , these seed can be used as \nseed. But, if it is less than 85% germination, eith er other quality seed have to be \nprocured or sow the seed more. \n  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n \n \n Techniques of testing Germination of seed \nFig. No. 5.5.1 Making line with finger \nFig. No. 5.5.3 Maize seeds sowed in row                       \nFig. No. 5.5.5 Watering the planted seeds \n \n \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \nTechniques of testing Germination of seed \nFig. No. 5.5.1 Making line with finger \nFig. No. 5.5.3 Maize seeds sowed in row                       \nFig. No. 5.5.5 Watering the planted seeds \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \nTechniques of testing Germination of seed \nFig. No. 5.5.1 Making line with finger \nFig. No. 5.5.3 Maize seeds sowed in row                       \nFig. No. 5.5.5 Watering the planted seeds \nFig No. 5.5 Procedure for maize \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  \n Techniques of testing Germination of seed \nFig. No. 5.5.1 Making line with finger  \nFig. No. 5.5.3 Maize seeds sowed in row                       \nFig. No. 5.5.5 Watering the planted seeds \nFig No. 5.5 Procedure for maize \nSource: \n \n \nTechniques of testing Germination of seed  \n \nFig. No. 5.5.2 \n \nFig. No. 5.5.3 Maize seeds sowed in row                       Fig. No. 5.5.4 Covering seeds with soil \n \nFig. No. 5.5.5 Watering the planted seeds  Fig. No. 5.5.6 Sprouted maize plant \nFig No. 5.5 Procedure for maize \nSource: JICA P roject \nFig. No. 5.5.2 Sowing maize seeds in line \nFig. No. 5.5.4 Covering seeds with soil \nFig. No. 5.5.6 Sprouted maize plant \nFig No. 5.5 Procedure for maize seed germination test \nroject Team \nSowing maize seeds in line \nFig. No. 5.5.4 Covering seeds with soil \nFig. No. 5.5.6 Sprouted maize plant \nseed germination test  \nSowing maize seeds in line \nFig. No. 5.5.4 Covering seeds with soil \nFig. No. 5.5.6 Sprouted maize plant  \n \n12 \n \nSowing maize seeds in line  \n \nFig. No. 5.5.4 Covering seeds with soil  \n \n12  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n \n \n 5.6 T \nMaize seeds should be treated by fungicides for con trolling damping \nstage. \n• \n• \n• \n Maize Farming Techniques Manual \n5.6 T reatment of seed before sowing \nMaize seeds should be treated by fungicides for con trolling damping \nstage.

Therefore, field \nshould be cleaned after harvesting.  \n(B) Application of FYM (Farm yard manure) \n• Around 50-60 bamboo baskets ( DOKO ) of well-fermented FYM per Ropani of \nland should be applied during the land preparation or first plowing (1-2 month \nearlier of cultivation).  \n• Use of unfermented FYM (farm yard manure) can incre ase pest such as white \ngrubs, cut worms and other worms. \n• In case, heaps of FYM put in the field for long tim e, the nutrients in the FYM will \nbe lost and insect may lay eggs in the heaps also. So, it should be better spread the \nmanure and plow the field immediately.  \n(C)  First ploughing \n• 1-2 month before planting, during Dec-Jan, first pl owing should be done.  \n• Plowing should be done after putting the well ferme nted FYM (50-60 DOKO  / \nRopani) as organic fertilizer on the field.  \n•  Plough the field two times, which will make the so il loose, and make easy for \naeration and root growth. In the first time, plough  the filed 5-8 cm deep and \nsecond time 10-15 cm deep should be done.  \n• In case, there is big size of soil clods present in  the field after first plowing, the \nbreaking of those clods should be done manually wit h the help of spade or other \nequipment before those clods become hard.  \n(D)  Second plowing and sowing of maize \n• The field should be ploughed second time just befor e seed sowing in line with the \napplication of basal dose of chemical fertilizers. Apply 2.6 kg of Urea, 3 kg of \nDAP, 2.5 kg of Potash per Ropani as a basal dose of  fertilizer. \n• Line sowing has an advantage over broadcasting as i t requires less seed, facilitates \neasy weed control.  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n \n \n (E)  \nMonth  \nArea \nHigh \nhills \nMid-\nhills \nTerai \nor low \nland Maize Farming Techniques Manual \n• Just after sowing of seeds, we should press the soi l, which will conserve the \nmo isture \nFig. No. 5.7.1 Farmer \nmaize cultivation \nSource: JICA Project Team \n Sowing  \n(I)  Time of Maize sowing and harvesting according to di fferent region \nFor the maize cultivation, Average temperature \nFeb/ \nMar  Mar/ \nApr \n  \n  \n  \nTime \nTime of harvesting \nSource: \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \nJust after sowing of seeds, we should press the soi l, which will conserve the \nisture , and will \nFig. No. 5.7.1 Farmer \nmaize cultivation  \nJICA Project Team \nTime of Maize sowing and harvesting according to di fferent region \nFor the maize cultivation, Average temperature \nTime of maize sowing & \nMar/ \nApr  Apr/ \nMay  \n \n \n \nTime of sowing \nTime of harvesting \nSource: JICA P \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  \n Just after sowing of seeds, we should press the soi l, which will conserve the \nand will help, for easy germination. \nFig. No. 5.7.1 Farmer  plowing  \nJICA Project Team  \nTime of Maize sowing and harvesting according to di fferent region \nFor the maize cultivation, Average temperature \nTime of maize sowing & \n \n May/ \nJune \n \n \n \nof sowing  \nTime of harvesting  \nJICA P roject Team \n \nJust after sowing of seeds, we should press the soi l, which will conserve the \nfor easy germination. \n \n land for \nTime of Maize sowing and harvesting according to di fferent region \nFor the maize cultivation, Average temperature \nTable No.5.7.1 \nTime of maize sowing & harvesting in different region \nJune/ \nJuly July/ \nAug \n  \n  \n  \neam  \nJust after sowing of seeds, we should press the soi l, which will conserve the \nfor easy germination.  \nFig. No. 5.7.2 Farmers preparing rows \nfor maize cultivation \nSource: JICA Project Team \nTime of Maize sowing and harvesting according to di fferent region \nFor the maize cultivation, Average temperature  of 24 hours \nTable No.5.7.1  \nharvesting in different region \nJuly/ \nAug  Aug/ \nSept \n  \n  \n  \nJust after sowing of seeds, we should press the soi l, which will conserve the \nFig. No. 5.7.2 Farmers preparing rows \nfor maize cultivation  \nJICA Project Team \nTime of Maize sowing and harvesting according to di fferent region \nof 24 hours  should be at least 10 º C \nharvesting in different region \nAug/ \nSept  Sept \n/ Oct \n \n \n \nJust after sowing of seeds, we should press the soi l, which will conserve the \n \nFig. No. 5.7.2 Farmers preparing rows \n \nJICA Project Team  \nTime of Maize sowing and harvesting according to di fferent region  \nshould be at least 10 º C \nharvesting in different region  \n/ Oct  Oct \n/ \nNov  Nov/ \nDec \n  \n  \n  \n15 \nJust after sowing of seeds, we should press the soi l, which will conserve the \n \nFig. No. 5.7.2 Farmers preparing rows \nshould be at least 10 º C .  \nNov/ \nDec  Dec/ \nJan  \n \n \n 15  \nDec/ \n Jan/ \nFeb \n \n \n \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  16 \n \n  \n   \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  17 \n \n  \n (II) Amount of seed  \nIn case of germination rate over than 85%, we shoul d apply the seed rate as \nmentioned in the table below.

Henc e firstly, after 25-30 days of \nsowing, we should weed the field, and take the weed s away from the field.  \n• Weeding will help the maize seedlings to relieve fr om competition with weeds.  \n(B)  Thinning \n• After 25-30 days of sowing maize or at 4-5 leaf sta ge, thinning should be done.  \n• Thinning means practice of keeping only one healthy  seedling removing another \nseedling from each spot. \n• Thinning should be done just after the first weedin g at the same time.  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  20 \n \n  \n • Thinning helps to control competition for nutrition , water, and sunlight among the \nplants. As a result, remained one plant develops we ll.  \n(C)  Transplanting \n• The removed plants during thinning can be transplan ted to the missing spot of \nfield. \n• In case the missing spot found, the transplanting s hould be done after enough \nwatering. But, the root of the maize plant should b e pulled out with soil in the \nroot; otherwise, there might be problem of no forma tion of cob, or no kernel on \nthe cob.  \n(D)  First top dressing \n• After 25-30 days of sowing, we have to apply urea i mmediately as first top \ndressing. Applying of 0.87 kg Urea per Ropani, firs t weeding should be done 25-\n30 days after sowing. We should apply quarter tea s poon of urea near (5-10 cm) to \neach plant, and cover it by soil.  \n6.2 Second farm work: (25-30 days after 1st  farm work) \n(A)  Second weeding \nThe weeds should also be removed on knee-height sta ge as second weeding after 20-\n25 days of first weeding.  \n(B)  Second top dressing \nAfter 20-25 days of first top dressing, during knee  height stage, we should apply the \nurea as second top dressing near the plant (5-10 cm  from plant) after second weeding, \nlike first top dressing. \n(C)  Making ridge \n• After the second weeding and top dressing, each nod al root of maize plant should \nbe covered by soil for the prevention of lodging in  plants. \n• At the same time of covering, we should make the dr ainage way between each \nline of plants, which helps to prevent lodging whil e it rains heavily.   \n  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  21 \n \n  \n 6.3 Third farm work: (25-30 days after second farm work) \n(A)  Third weeding \nThe weeds should be removed again on tasselling sta ge as third weeding after 20-25 \ndays of second weeding applying the urea.  \n(B)  Third top dressing \nAfter 20-25 days of second top dressing, during tas seling stage, we have to apply urea \nnear each plant ( 5-10 cm) as third top dressing im mediately just after 3 rd  weeding.  \n(C)  Making ridge \nAfter the third weeding and top dressing, each noda l root of maize plant should be \ncovered by soil for the prevention of lodging in pl ants. \n(D)  Making drainage \nIn the fourth farm work, drainage should be made be tween each line of plants, which \nwill help to prevent root rot problems by plant log ging during heavy rain. \n7. Irrigation: only in case of availability of irri gation facility  \nFor better maize production, soil must have adequat e moisture until 40-45 days from \nsowing. Likewise, Soil moisture should be maintaine d also in the tasseling and kernel \ndeveloping stage. Irrigation is necessary after the  first weeding and during the tassel stage \nif the field goes dry. \n8. Weed Management \n• If weeding is not done in proper time, the unnecess ary weeds and plants compete for \nnutrients, light, water and place, which obstructs in proper growth of plants and \ndecreases yields. \n• Therefore, unnecessary plants and weeds have to be removed in well manner. This \nresults for better production by well growth and de velopment of plant,  \n  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  22 \n \n  \n 8.1 Major weeds in maize field \na)  Commelina grass \nb)  Digiteria grass  \nc)  Cyperus grass \nd)  Cynodon grass \ne)  Ageratum grass \n8.2 Methods of controlling weeds \n• Plow the maize filed properly earlier to cultivatio n. \n• At time of sowing, remove weeds and cover the maize  plant by soil during the time of \nweeding (20-25 days of sowing). \n• The weeds like Cyperus  should be uprooted together with the underground r oots, and \nroot galls should be buried or burned away from the  field.  \n• If the field is ploughed in summer season, the weed s die due to the sun light. \n9. Major Disease, Pests and Methods of Controlling Them \n9.1. Major causes of disease and pest attack \n• Use of not well-decomposed FYM. \n• Residues of previous crops. \n• Lack of proper cleaning of the field. \n• The fungal disease like Downey mildew can attack, i f the temperature and humidity is \nhigh. \n  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n \n \n 9.2 \nFig. No. 9.2.1 White Grub \nSource: Plant Protection \nDirectorate, Hariharbhawan, \nLalitpur \nFig. No. 9.2.2 Maize stem \nborer \nSource: Plant Protection \nDirectorate, Hariharbhawan, \nLalitpur \n \n \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n.2 Major pest and \nPests  \nFig. No. 9.2.1 White Grub \nSource: Plant Protection \nDirectorate, Hariharbhawan, \nLalitpur  \nFig. No. 9.2.2 Maize stem \nSource: Plant Protection \nDirectorate, Hariharbhawan, \nLalitpur  \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \nMajor pest and control \n \nFig. No. 9.2.1 White Grub  \nSource: Plant Protection \nDirectorate, Hariharbhawan, \nFig. No. 9.2.2 Maize stem \nSource: Plant Protection \nDirectorate, Hariharbhawan, \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  \n control  methods \nSymptoms of \ndamage \nSource: Plant Protection \nDirectorate, Hariharbhawan, It lives in soil, and \nfeed roots, which \ncaused death of \nplant \nFig. No. 9.2.2 Maize stem \nSource: Plant Protection \nDirectorate, Hariharbhawan, It initially feeds \nleaves, and finally \nenters inside stalk \nand damages it \neating the growing \nshoot and flesh \ninside.  \n \n \nmethods  \nSymptoms of \ndamage  \nIt lives in soil, and \nfeed roots, which \ncaused death of \nIt initially feeds \nleaves, and finally \nenters inside stalk \nand damages it \neating the growing \nshoot and flesh \n It lives in soil, and \nfeed roots, which \ncaused death of • Plowing the field, and destroy it \npicking up the white grub manually \n• Do not use unfermented FYM. \n• Use Hamal \n• In case, there is the prevalence of \nwhite grub every year, Use 2 kg \nMeterhizium pesticide per Ropani \nmixing with soil during second \nplowing time. \n• If there is highly \ngrub, we also can use M \nat second weeding time in s \nIt initially feeds \nleaves, and finally \nenters inside stalk \nand damages it \neating the growing \nshoot and flesh • Remove the borer infected maize \nplant from the field, and can also be \nfed to the animal. \n• Use H\nmixing with equal amount of water. \n• Use Carbofuran pesticide 4 \ngranules per plant placing them at \ntassel growing part of maize at \nknee-height stage.

Introduction \nGenerally Nepalese farmers have the practice of col lecting FYM from their livestock shed \nas an organic fertilizer for their crop fields. \nFarm Yard Manure is the manure prepared in decompos ed from by collecting dung and \nurine of farm animals along with wastes feeds, fodd er, and the bedding materials. FYM is \nthe main organic manure used in Nepal. \nHowever, Nepalese farmers have the practice of appl ying immature (un-decomposed) \nFYM in their field. Immature manure FYM can cause t he generation of harmful gas \nammonia and wilting, and disturb for well germinati on of seeds. And, also the immature \n(un-decomposed) manure does not improve soil condit ioning capacity of increasing water \nholding and fertilizer holding ability. Weed seeds can also survive inside manure and as a \nresult, weeds problems occur in the field.  \nWell decomposed FYM can solve many crop growth prob lems in the fields.  \n2. Advantages of Well Decomposed Farm Yard Manure ( FYM) \n2.1 Improvement of soil productivity \n• Application of well decomposed FYM in soil act as a  soil conditioner which is \ncapable of improving moisture holding, fertilizers holding and air passing capacity; as \nwell as  it helps the capacity of drainage to soil in good balance. This type of soil is \nvery useful for good growth and development of plan ts.  \n• By the application of well decomposed FYM, some por tions of nutrients are available \ndirectly to the plants, and remaining nutrients in soil is released to plants for long time.  \n• The materials that soak urine should be used as bed ding materials in animal shed \nwhich can help to minimize the loss of urine. Other wise, we can also make the urine \ncollecting place separately with plastic or cemente d structure, and use urine as \nfertilizers. \n• By using well decomposed FYM in field, fewer amount s of chemical fertilizers are \nalso enough for crop, which can also save the money .  \n \nTable No. 2.1 \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  32 \n \n  \n Composition of FYM \nMaterials  Nitrogen \n(%) Phosphorus \n(%) Potash (%) \nPaddy straw 0.42 0.20 0.45 \nCow dung 0.71 0.70 0.74 \nPig feces 1.35 1.94 1.05 \nSource: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishe ries, Japan 2000 \n2.2 Healthy for plants \n• Well decomposed FYM is free from weed seeds; plant pathogenic Fungi, bacteria & \nparasites.  \n• Around temperatures of 55 °C to 65 °C during decomp osition, many microorganisms, \nplant pathogenic fungi, bacteria and parasites are destroyed.  \n2.3 Good means of breakdown of organic matter \n• FYM is the good means of breakdown of organic matte r in simpler form \n• During decomposition of FYM, high temperature insid e is accelerated, which helps to \nbreakdown of structural molecules of bedding materi als (straw, weed, grasses of feed, \netc.) into simpler nutrient form which can be easil y uptake by plant after its \napplication. \n3. Material Required for Making FYM \n• Animal excreta: Dung, Urine \n• Bedding materials: Straw, saw dust, dry leaves etc.  \n4. The Place for Making FYM \nPlace for collecting and making decomposed FYM shou ld be as followings: \n• The nearer place to animal shed  \n• Elevated & well drained place \n• Place of easy care and observation  \n• It is recommended two places for the preparation of  well decomposed FYM manure. \nTherefore total two place should be selected as men tioned below:  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n \n \n (B)  Maize Farming Techniques Manual \n\u0002 First storage place \n\u0002 Second storage place \n(A)  First storage place \n• Every day animal dung, urine and \nbedding materials should be \ncollected on the surface near the \nanimal shed. \n• Usually pits of 8 meters length x 2 \nmeters wide x 1 meter depth \ndimensions should be prep \nnearby the animal shed, but the \ndimension may varies according to \nthe land availability and number of \nanimals. \n• After putting the manure (Dung together with beddin g materials) from animals \nshed in first place up to 2 months, let it remain f urther up to 2 months without \nputting other manures over it.

It is \nimportant to protect manure from sunlight and rain to protect micronutrients; \notherwise the micronutrients in the manure will be lost.  \n(C)  Actual Procedure for collecting and using FYM  \n• The fresh dung together with bedding materials shou ld be collected daily from \nanimal sheds to the first storage place up to 2 mon ths properly, and let it remains \nfor next 2 month by covering it with dry leaves, st raw or plastic sheet.  \n• After fulfilling the manure in first storage place,  the manures should be collected \ndaily to the next storage place.  \n• Put the manure in next storage up to 2 months and c over it like as in first place, \nand let it remains for next two months.  \n• The manure already becomes fermented in first place  up to two months, when we \nare collecting dung in second place. So, we can app ly the manure from first place \nto the field, and the first place will become empty  and we can collect the dung \nagain on first place. This cycle continue on every two month period on first and \nsecond places. This way, we can get well fermented FYM.  \n5. Condition Required for Well Decomposition of FYM  \nWell decomposition of manure is required for making  good FYM.  For making well \ndecomposed manure, the following things should be c onsidered well during its \npreparation:  \n• After piled up the fresh FYM, moisture content of t he FYM should be managed 50-\n65%. It can be known by squeezing the manure in pal m of hand, if it is wet.  If \nmoisture is less, water should be sprayed, and if m oisture is high, the manures should \nbe dried in shadow by removing cover for 1-2 days.  \n• The fresh FYM temperature rises up to 70 degrees Ce lsius within 2 to 3 weeks (1 \nweek in summer) after deposition, which is not good  for well decomposition of FYM. \nTherefore, we should be careful for turning over at  every 60 ºC for two to three times.  \nIt can be known by putting hand inside the manure a nd feel hot. \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n \n \n • \n• \n6.

Introduction \n• Compost manure can be prepared as alternative to FY M.  \n• Compost making is the best option for the farmers w ho don’t rear the animals or \ncattle's with them.  \n• Compost manure is decomposed mixture of straws, gra sses, fodder, ash, leaves and \nother parts of trees, farm waste, kitchen waste and  similar material, together with \ndung if possible.  \n• Compost manure is generally prepared in pit or heap  by making different layers of \nraw materials covering with mud or plastic. One woo den stake or bamboo is put in the \nmiddle for well development of bacteria and to be d ecomposed. \n• The temperature inside the manure should be felt ho t. While we put our hand inside \nthe manures, the temperature is up to 50-60 ºC at t hat time.  \n• Emulsifying concentrate (E. M.) should be sprayed i n each layer of the grasses or \nstraw or other raw materials during the preparation  of manure for quick \ndecomposition of the manure.  \n9. The Advantages of the Compost Manure \n• It provides necessary nutrients to the soil for imp roving its fertility.  \n• Increases the water absorbing capacity of soil. \n• Improves the physical, chemical and biological qual ity of soil. \n• Increase air aeration and water movement in the soi l.  \n• Manure can be kept in soil for long time.  \n• Increases the microbial activity in the soil; due t o which soil become soft, and \nincrease fertility status in the soil.  \n• Compost manure can be prepared in own accessible pl aces, so that it will be easy for \ncarrying manure in the field.  \n  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  38 \n \n  \n 10. The Materials Required for Making Compost Manur e \n• Waste straws and grasses. \n• Weeds, leaves fallen from trees. \n• Roots and stems of young plants. \n• Dung and urine of animals. \n• Organic kitchen product ( vegetable, food wastes)  \n• Limestone, ash, urea, etc.  \n11. The Place for Making Compost Manure \n• The near place from farm.  \n• Elevated & well drained place \n• Place of easy care and observation.  \n12.  Methods of Preparing Compost Manure \n12.1 Methods of preparing compost in pit \n(A)  Digging pit \n• It is better to dig a pit on winter season than in summer season due to which the \nchance of drying out of material is less.  \n• The length of the pit should be as per need, but de pth should not be more than one \nmeter. \n(B)  Filling pit  \n• The collected raw materials for making compost manu re should be kept arranging \nin layers inside the pit. \n• Wooden stick or a bamboo should be put in the middl e of the pit during filling \nmaterials inside the pit. \n• Spraying water in each layer of compost during its preparation will help for \nmaking good compost manure.  \n• It is better to make each layer up to15-20 cm (1 to  1.5 hand span). \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  39 \n \n  \n • We can also use dried leaves, green fodder, dung, w ater (2-3 liter of water in each \nlayer), lime powder (100-200 gm. in each layer), E.  M. liquid (Mixture of 1 liter \nE.M. and 10-15 liter water, and spray nearly 1 lite r in each layer) and forest soil \n(2-3 kg. in each layer) between each layer which he lp to decompose the manure \nwell.  \n• E.M. liquid, Dung, Urine, lime powder is not mandat ory, but it is better to apply \nfor producing well decomposed FYM.  \n• Lime powder preserves the manure from its acidity a nd increases the bacterial \nactivities. Likewise, forest soil increases the bac terial numbers.  \n• The use of dung and urine between the raw materials  will increase the quality of \nthe compost.  \n• The raw materials should be forcefully pressed insi de the pit so that it decays soon. \n(C)  Using bamboo or wood stake for manure ventilation \n• During the winter and dry summer, the compost shoul d be prepared by pit method \ndue to which the moisture can be preserved inside t he pit.  \n• In case the temperature inside the compost become s o much hot (over than 70 ºC), \nbacteria cannot be survived and that will damage th e compost, which will give the \nless quality of compost. Therefore, to maintain the  temperature only up to 60 ºC, \nbamboo or wooden stake should be put during the tim e of compost preparation.  \n• The bamboo or wooden stake should be swing or stirr ed round by hand in every \nweek for maintaining the temperature and passing ai r inside the manure, which \nwill give well decomposed compost manure after 3-4 month.    \n(D)  Covering by mud or plastic \n• After filling up the materials the pit should be co vered with mud. \n• Covering the pit with mud stops the spread of bad s mell and preserves manure \nfrom rain, direct sun-light and from nutrient loss.   \n  \n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n \n \n Maize Farming Techniques Manual \nMethods of producing compost by digging pit have be en presented as followings: \nFig. No. 12.1.1 Digging a p \nCompost Manure \nFig. No. 12.1.3 Pit ready for putting compost \nmaking materials \nFig. No. 12.1.5 Pressing the raw materials \nwith staking \nmanure \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \nMethods of producing compost by digging pit have be en presented as followings: \nFig. No. 12.1.1 Digging a p \nCompost Manure  \nFig. No. 12.1.3 Pit ready for putting compost \nmaking materials  \nFig. No. 12.1.5 Pressing the raw materials \nwith staking in the middle part to prepare \nMaize Farming Techniques Manual  \n Methods of producing compost by digging pit have be en presented as followings: \nFig. No. 12.1.1 Digging a p it for preparing \nFig. No. 12.1.3 Pit ready for putting compost \nFig. No. 12.1.5 Pressing the raw materials \nin the middle part to prepare \n \nMethods of producing compost by digging pit have be en presented as followings: \n \npreparing \n \nFig. No. 12.1.3 Pit ready for putting compost \n \nFig. No. 12.1.5 Pressing the raw materials \nin the middle part to prepare \nMethods of producing compost by digging pit have be en presented as followings: \n \nFig. No. \n \nFig. No. 12.1.3 Pit ready for putting compost Fig. No. 12.1.4 Putting raw materials for \ncompost making \nFig. No. 12.1.6 Sprayi \ncompost making \nMethods of producing compost by digging pit have be en presented as followings: \nFig. No. 12.1.2 Taking out soil from pit \nFig. No. 12.1.4 Putting raw materials for \ncompost making  \nFig. No. 12.1.6 Sprayi \ncompost making  \nMethods of producing compost by digging pit have be en presented as followings: \n12.1.2 Taking out soil from pit \nFig. No. 12.1.4 Putting raw materials for \nFig. No. 12.1.6 Sprayi ng the water for \n40 \nMethods of producing compost by digging pit have be en presented as followings:  \n12.1.2 Taking out soil from pit  \nFig. No. 12.1.4 Putting raw materials for \nng the water for \n40  \n \n \n \n \n\n\nMaize Farming Techniques Manual \n \n \n  \n12.2 Heap method Maize Farming Techniques Manual \n12.2 Heap method \n(A)  Me thods of making compost in heap \n• Compost manure also can be produced by making heap on earth surface without \ndigging a pit.

Maize is reasonably tolerant to soil acidity, but if the soil is very acid, li ming will \nimprove the soil and enhance maize yields. Maize is susceptible to both drought and water -\nlogging. Thus, poorly drained soils should be avoided, unless practices like ridge tillage, \ndrainage and early planting are employed. Drought during the fou r week period spanning \nflowering (silking and tasseling) can cause serious yield losses, and therefore some form of water \nconservation is important (e.g., pot -holing, mulching, tied -ridges), especially in the drier areas. \nTemperatures above 38 degrees celc ius affect yield by affaceting pollen viability while \ntemperatures below 10 retards maize growth.  \n \nFertilisation  \n \nThe fertiliser requirements of maize depends on the soil fertility and yield target. Infertile soils \nrequire more fertiliser, as does a highe r yield target. The two most important nutrients for maize \nare nitrogen and phosphorous, but maize also requires potassium and, on some soils, Zinc in \nsmall quantities. The first consideration for fertilising maize is manure, for it is an excellent \nsource of nutrients and has many other benefits for soils. Bought inorganic fertilisers should be \nconsidered as a supplement to manure. The following table gives a general recommendation for \nfertilising maize with inorganic fertilisers:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n     Yield potenti al of maize   \n       \n Fertiliser   Less than  \n3 to 5 t/ha  5 to 8 t/ha  8 to > 12 t/ha   \nType   \n3 t/ha       \n       \n    Number of 50kg bags of fertiliser per ha   \n       \n       \n Basal fertilizer  0 to 3 bags/ha  2 to 5 bags/ha  5 to 7 bags/ha  6 to 12 bag s/ha \n (e.g. 7:14:7)  \n(0 to 150kg/ha)  (100 to 250kg/ha)  (250 to 350kg/ha)  (300 to 600kg/ha)     \n       \n Top dressing \nfertilizer  1 to 3 bags/ha  2 to 5 bags/ha  5 to 7 bags/ha  6 to 10 bags/ha  \n (high N) e.g  (50 to 150kg/ha)  (100 to 250kg/ha)  (250 to 350k g/ha)  (250 to 500kg/ha)  \n ammonium nitrate      \n (34.5% N)      \n \nFacts:  \n \n The yield potential largely depends on the variety, expected rainfall and on the \nmanagement applied to the crop.  \n \n The addition of manure and ash will greatly improve the response of m aize to the applied \nfertiliser. Under commercial set ups addition of lime to acidic soils improve response to \nfertilisers  \n \n Fertiliser rates may be reduced after a drought, where manure and ash is applied or when \nthe maize is following a legume or well -fertilised crop, like potatoes.  \n\n4 \n  \n The basal fertiliser must be applied before or at the time of planting, preferably cupped \ninto the planting hole, or applied in a band below and to the side of the seed with the \nmechanical planter.  \n \n The top dressing should be a pplied when the maize at 3.5 to 6 Weeks After crop \nEmergence -WACE.  \n Top dressing splits may be recommended in sandy to sandy loam soils. A maximum of 3 \nusually is ideal  \n \n Basal fertilisers which contains zinc are recommended for application every two to thr ee \nyears on sandy soils.  \n \n If boronated fertilisers are not normally applied as part of the rotation, then a boronated \nfertiliser should be applied every three years.  \n \nThe approximate application rates (to the nearest half -bag) of inorganic  \n \nfertilisers to crops can be determined from the following tables:  \n \nBasal fertilizers e.g. 7,14,7  \n \nPlant Spacing     Cup size      \n          \nBetween  Between  \n5 8 12 16 22   \nRows  Plants    \n        \n        \n  \nFertilizer rate (kg/ha)      \n(Cm)  (Cm)        \n\n5 \n           \n          \n100 50 125 200 275 375 525   \n          \n90 60 100 175 250 350 475   \n          \n90 50 125 250 300 425 575   \n          \n90 30 200 350 525 700 950   \n          \n75 60 125 200 300 425 575   \n          \n50 50 250 375 550 750 1050    \n  Top Dre ssing Fertilizers (TOP) e.g. 34.5% N     \n         \n          \nPlant Spacing     Cup size      \n          \nBetween  Between  \n5 8 12 16 22   \nRows  Plants    \n        \n        \n  \nFertilizer rate (kg/ha)      \n(Cm)  (Cm)        \n         \n          \n100 50 100 150 250 325 450   \n         \n90 60 100 150 225 300 400   \n\n6 \n          \n90 50 100 175 250 350 500   \n         \n90 30 200 300 450 600 800   \n         \n75 60 100 175 250 350 500   \n         \n50 50 200 325 500 650 875   \n \n \nNOTE:  \n \n 1 ha =2.5 acres  \n \n 1 bag of fe rtiliser = 50kg  \n \n To convert kg/ha to bags per hectare, divide by 100 and multiply by 2.  \n \n To convert kg/ha to kg per acre, divide by 2.5 (or multiply by 0.4).  \n \n Specific amounts of fertilizer will vary according to the specific density of the fertilizer \nused. \n \nPlant spacing  \n \nThe width of rows and the spacing of plants in the row determines the plant population. The \ncloser the spacing, the more plants there will be per unit area. The recommended number of \nmaize plants per hectare varies from 36,000 to 60,000, depending on the environmental yield \npotential and hybrid. High plant populations are appropriate for early -planted crops under high \nrainfall or irrigated conditions where management is of a good standard. Lower plant populations \n\n7 \n should be used under dryla nd conditions, especially in drought prone areas, where a population \nof about 37,000 to 40, 000 plants per hectare is recommended. Some varieties may be susceptible \nto lodging under high plant populations. Generally, the taller the variety, the lower shoul d be the \nplant population. Short maize varieties may be grown at higher plant populations. Whatever the \ncase, the minimum plant population for maize is 36,000 plants per ha.  \n \n \n \n  \n\n\n8 \n The plant populations for the various Seed Co hybrids related to the expecte d yield is \npresented in the Table below:  \n \nHYBRIDS            \n \n  ULTRA & \nVERY \nEARLY   EARLY  MEDIUM  LATE   \n          \n        SC719   \n        SC727   \n Expected  SC403  SC513   SC533   SC608(Y)    \n Yield  SC417  SC529  \nSC533   SC537  SC637  SC633    \n T/ha  SC419     SC627     \n  SC402     SC649     \n      SC 643     \n 1 36000  32000        \n 2 36000  36000   32000      \n 3 40000  36000   36000  32000  36000    \n 4 40000  40000   36000  32000  36000    \n 5 44000  40000   40000  36000  40000    \n6 44000  44000   40000  36000  40000    \n 7 48000  44000   40000 40000  44000  37000   \n 8 52000  48000   44000  44000  47000  40000   \n 9 56000  55000   48000  48000  48000  48000   \n10 60000    52000  49000  48000  49000   \n 11    56000  50000  50000  50000   \n 12 SC419@60k    60000  55000  60000  52000   \n 13     55000  60000  52000   \n 14     55000  60000  55000   \n>15       55000   \n \n\n9 \n A seed rate of about 25 kg/ha is required, but this depends on the seed size. 10 kg is enough to \nplant 1 acre and 5 kg for half an acre. Small seed will go further, and give equal germination and \nyield performance as large seed. However, small seed should not be planted too deep (i.e., not \ndeeper than 5 cm). For SC 727, a 50, 000 kernel (1 hectare pack) is enough to plant 1 Ha, 20, 000 \nkernel for 1 Acre.  \n \nThe following table gives the number of plants per hectare at v arious spacings for hand \nplanting:  \n \nSpacing  Spacing between \nplant  Number of  Plant population  \nbetween rows  station  plants per  (plants per ha)  \n(cm)  \n(cm)  station   \n   \n    \n100 60 2 33 300  \n    \n100 50 2 40 000  \n    \n90 60 2 37 000  \n    \n90 30 1 37 000  \n90 50 2 44 400  \n    \n90 40 2 55 500  \n    \n75 60 2 44 400  \n90 22 1 50 500  \n75 24 1 55 555  \n75 25 1 53 333  \n \n\n10 \n Key:  \n Recommended in low rainfall areas e.g. regions 4 &5  \n Recommended in high rainfall areas e.g. region 1 to 3 or irrigated \nareas  \n \nNB: To derive y our population per hectare divide 10,000 by your row spacing (m) and then \ndivide the answer by the spacing between the plant stations in metres.

The farmers are targeting populations densities such as 65 000, \n70 000, 80 000 up to 100 000 are being achieved. The trend or condition is that th e farmers are \ncoming in with a growth regulator such as CeCeCe (@ 2.1l/Ha) and Ethrel before day 35 after \nemergence. However this comes at a cost in terms extra seed cost, extra compensatory \nfertilization, spraying cost, and risk of response failure especi ally when spraying times coincides \nwith extended wet periods.  \nThere is need for further research especially the whether the yield gains are significant (or if they \ndo exist in the first place), profitability of this concept, breeding for short statured bu t high \nyielding varieties to accommodate high densities. However we recommend optimum population \ndensities of 50 000 to 60 000 plants per Ha on all Seed Co varieties in Zimbabwe.  \nPlanting date  \n \nThe later maize is planted, the lower the yield, as shown in the graph below. Highest yields are \nobtained with October plantings, but these can usually only be sustained with irrigation (ie \nirrigation to establish crop). However, planting in October may be feasible on vleis or when there \nis good early rain (over 50m m). November planting with the onset of the first rains is the safest \nunder dryland conditions. In order to exploit these early rains, fields need to be ready before the \nrains (i.e. in October) and seed and fertiliser must be on hand, so that as soon as th e first rains \nfall, fields may be planted. Planting in December will produce low yields, and is very risky, \nbecause the crop may suffer from drought stress at the end of the season, while pests (e.g. stalk \nborer) and diseases (maize streak virus and HT) ar e more prevalent on late planted crops. Under \nrainfed situations, after second week of November a farmer is encouraged to dry plant anyway at \na depth of about 5 cm to ensure the seed is not reached by light showers.  \n \n\n13 \n  \n \nOn average, for every day that plant ing is delayed, the yield loss is one bag (50 kg) per ha. This \nis a significant loss and something to be remembered by those who wish to be productive \nfarmers. Early planting with the right Seed Co maize hybrid, together with fertiliser and manure \nand the control of early weeds will make a large difference to the productivity of farmers' fields.  \n \nVarietal choice  \n \nThe choice of variety depends on the yield potential, season length, anticipated disease problems \nand use. The Seed Co Product Manual gives descri ptions and recommendations of all the Seed \nCo hybrids on the market. It is best to study that manual and determine  \nwhich hybrid will be best for each situation.  \n \nConsiderations when choosing maize hybrid varieties  \n amount and distribution of rainfall  \n length  of the growing season  \n altitude and air temperature  \n soil fertility and fertiliser application  \n planting date  \n plant density  \n\n\n14 \n  use (commercial grain, green mealie and silage)  \n occurrence of pests and diseases  \n management  \n \nPointer!  \n \nAlways plant new certified See d Co  \nseed each year for maximum yields.  \n \nEarly maturing hybrids take between 120 and 140 days from planting to maturity, whereas \nmedium to late maturing varieties take between 141 and 155 days to mature. However the time \nto maturity for any variety depen ds on air temperature: the cooler the temperatures the longer the \nplants will take to mature. Seed Co Limited has a very simple way of differentiating their hybrids \nusing animal symbols as given in the accompanying table.  \n \n[Put brochure here]  \n \nThe range of  hybrids available from Seed Co is continuously changing as we develop new \nhybrids with improved performance and disease tolerance. Therefore, it is important to keep \noneself informed by attending field days and reading adverts.  \nIt is a good idea to grow m ore than one maize hybrid on a farm. Approximately half the fields \nshould be planted to a familiar variety that is most suited to your environment, one quarter to an \nearlier maturing hybrid and one quarter to a later maturing hybrid. Start planting with th e later \nmaturing hybrid and end with the earlier maturing hybrid. Also consider trying out a small area \nof one or two new hybrids to compare their performance with hybrids you know.  \nAltitude has an effect on the number of days from planting to flowering an d maturity because the \nrate of development of maize is affected by air temperature. The warmer the weather, the faster \ncrop development is. Higher temperatures at lower altitudes therefore have the effect of \naccelerating the development rate. Conversely, t he lower air temperatures at higher altitudes \nretard development and extend the time taken to reach flowering and maturity. The graph below \n\n15 \n gives a rough guide as to the time from planting to maturity for the four groups of Seed Co maize \nhybrids:  \nThe appro ximate time from planting to maturity for Seed Co maize hybrids at different \naltitudes  \n \n \n \n \nKey:  \n 700 series e.g. SC 727 and SC 719  \n 600 Series e.g. SC 649, SC 637, SC 627, SC 633, \nSC 643  \n 500 series e.g. SC 513, SC 533, SC 529  \n 400 series e.g. SC 403, SC 419  \n \nPlanting  \n \n\n\n16 \n Maize yield declines as planting is delayed after the first week of November. Therefore plant as \nearly as possible. For hand planting, this may be achieved if the farmer is well prepared. The \nfollowing guidelines help plan an early plant ing: \n \n Obtain fertiliser and seed in September or earlier.  \n \n Prepare planting holes early (i.e., in August or September) and cup -in the compound \nfertiliser so that all fields are ready for planting by the end of October.  \n \n It is unwise to plant in October, un less substantial rain has been received (i.e., more than \n50 mm rain (within 3 days) and the soil is wet down to 45 cm on clays and 60 cm on \nsands).  \n \n In November, after each rainfall event, check the soil moisture status by digging in the \nfield. Sow seed if  the soil is wet down to 30 cm on clay soils or 50 cm on sandy soils. If \nmore than 25 mm of rain has fallen, plant as much as you can in two days and then stop \nuntil further rain is received.  \n \n If no planting rains have fallen by the second week of November , then dry plant. Ensure \nthe seed is placed into dry soil at a depth of 5 -6cm.  \n \n In all planting operations ensure the seed is well covered with loose soil and pressed, so \nas to achieve good seed -soil contact. Avoid covering the seed with clods or rocks.  \n \n Soaking seeds in water for 12 hours (overnight) hastens germination, but such seed must \nbe planted into  wet soil the day after soaking . However with this practice farmers \nshould note that they will be washing away the fungicides and pesticides which are \nnormally used to treat certified seed. These prevents early disease and pest infestations.  \n\n17 \n Mid-season management  \n1. Weed control, especially in the first 10 weeks after crop emergence is essential. Hoeing is \neffective, and is easiest when weeds are small and on  small portions. However, if the fields are \nbigger enough and your management is good, herbicides are recopmmended. There is a wide \nselection of pre -emergence herbicides for maize, but a common combination is \nAlachlor/Metalachlor and Atrazine applied pre -emergence. When applying herbicides, read and \nfollow the label instructions and take the necessary safety precautions.  \n \n2. Rain -harvesting techniques should be employed as early as possible, e.g., mulching, pot -\nholing, tied -ridging or wet ripping. This is part icularly beneficial in the dry areas where rainfall \nis unreliable.  \n \n3. Top dress with Ammonium Nitrate/Urea when the maize is 4 to 6 weeks old. Maize on \nsandy soils may require a split top -dressing, with the first half applied at 4 weeks and the second \nat 7 w eeks after emergence. Use appropriate sized fertiliser cups to place the fertiliser near each \nplant, or dribble -band the fertiliser along the row with a suitably calibrated pipe attached to a bag \n(chola). Fertiliser applicators are recommended to band top dressing fertilizer on the interrows. \nThese can be calibrated and adjusted depending on the intended rates.  \n \n4. Check for stalk borer damage at 4 to 6 weeks after planting. The characteristic evidence of \nearly infection of stalk borer is the appearance of nu merous small holes in the new leaves in the \nfunnel. If necessary apply insecticide granules or sprays into the funnels of the maize plants to \ncontrol stalkborers. It is important to control the first generation of stalkborers, otherwise a \nsecond generation  may develop which will be more numerous and difficult to control.  \n5. Start to check for Fall Army Worm damage at 2 to 3 weeks after planting and make spraying \ndecisions early before damage reaches economic levels. Leaves show typical bullet -shot holes \nand l eaves dry horse manure -like droppings called frass on the leaves particularly the central \nwhorl. Leaves show a typical “window pane” damage. The damage includes holes on the stem \ncausing significant stalk lodge, the cob and the tassel.  \n \n \n\n18 \n 6. Control late weeds  with the hoe or herbicides from flowering onwards, as this reduces weed \npressure, weed seed reservoirs, and also makes the harvesting operation easier.  \n \n7. Harvest the crop as early as possible to reduce in -field losses. If whole cobs are harvested \nand place d in an outside grain crib for storage until shelling, protect this from rain. Shell the cobs \nas soon as possible to minimise infection by weevils. Store the grain when it is dry and protect it \nfrom insects and rodents. The best place for grain storage is a cool dry room that prohibits the \nentry of moisture and rodents. The application of a grain protectant chemical will prevent \ninfection by weevils and other storage pests.  \nHard facts about weeds in maize  \n \n The annual yield loss in maize as a result of weed problems can reach 50% or more  \n The crop must have a good head start ahead of weeds  \n The crop must be weed free for the first 10 weeks of the crop cycle after crop emergence  \n This is the most critical time when the crop requires at least 50% of the nutrients and \nhence must be weed free  \n If you fail to control weeds in maize in the first 5 weeks of the crop cycle, then 50% of \nthe yields will be lost.  \n Never allow weeds to seed, it will enhance the weed seed bank and result in future weed \ncontrol costs increases and difficulties.  \n There are more than 20 herbicides registered in Zimbabwe which can be sprayed on \nmaize crop. The choice is very wide!  \nYield forecasting in maize  \nSteps:  \n• Walk the land to ensure that the stand is even, standing (not lodging) and has no ma ny gaps  \n• Reap the cobs from a measured 20 sq. metres. If the rows are at 90cm, then you should reap \n22m row length, if the rows are 75cm, then measure 26.6m row length.  \n• Shell the cobs, weigh the grain and determine the moisture content using a moisture  meter  \n• Do this for three or four separate samples at widely separate points and determine the \naverage  \n\n19 \n • Use the formula below to calculate yield average estimate corrected to 1 ha and to 12.5% \nMoisture Content  \n• Mass Grain (Kg) x (100 -moisture content)/ (100-12.5) x10 000/20  \nNB: The formula automatically correct the final yield to 12.5% moisture content  \n ", "metadata": {"filename": "MAIZE GROWERS GUIDE.pdf", "type": "pdf"}}]
